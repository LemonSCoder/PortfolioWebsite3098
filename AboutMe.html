  <h1> About Me: </h1>
  <ul>
    <li> Critical Thinker </li>
    <li> Independent </li>
    <li> Heavy Planner </li>
    <li> Diligent </li>
    <li> Persevering </li>
  </ul>
  <p> I am a freshman at Emerald High School who aspires to go into the Computer Science field after graduation and get a master's degree. In college, I would like to work with Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality development, or robotics. I prefer to work in a job that requires me to be practical, creative, experimental, and working with the creation of the newest innovations, and I consider working on or physically building anything that could prove interesting, no matter how many test runs I do, the ideal job for me to pursue. I have already started working with Virtual Reality through Unity, creating 3-Dimensional models that could evenutally serve as Virtual Reality assets in the future, joined my school's Unmanned Aerial Vehicles club, and learned a little bit about Natural Language Processing in my own free time in order to acheive working in such jobs. </p> <br>
  <p> I am an ideal applicant because I would be able to cooperate with individuals in the workspace with differing backgrounds, philosophies, and abilities. I have already surrounded myself with others of different backgrounds, an example of this being that I was able to cooperate with others when my church and their church combined despite our political differences. I have friends who have varying political stances and philosophies, but I still respect their beliefs and don't think less of them for what they believe in. I am also persevering and a critical-thinker as an individual, for I have worked through multiple problems regarding my code in my Computer Science class at school without turning to Artificial Intelligence or any forums with possible code solutions to solve these problems. Finally, I am a heavy planner since I always want to be a step ahead from my other peers. One way this is represented is through me learning Spanish in my free time in order ot excel in my Spanish class with minimal study needed.</p> <br>
  <p> I have a diverse skillset, for I can code in Python, C#, and Java, speak Spanish and Japanese, animate fluidly in Flipaclip, and create 3D models in Blender among other skills I have. I would be able to be willing to learn any material neccessary to excel in my future endeavors since all of the skills I have listed above had a specific reason behind learning them. I learned Python in order to start learning Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, I learned C# and Blender so that I could code my own Virtual Reality game, I learned Japanese so that I could communicate with any citizens in Japan when going on vacation. I have taken piano and guitar lessons, am a part of my high school's band, have taken swim lessons in the past, and am currently taking Advanced Placement Statistics three years ahead of the rest of my peers. From these experiences, I have learned how to function with a team, step outside of my comfort zone, manage and schedule my time, and continue to be a curious and eager learner.</p> <br>
  <p> To conclude, my diverse skillset, my persistance and willingness to learn, and the diverse individuals I have surrounded myself with have allowed me to succeed in anything that I do as well as be a hopeful and promising applicant. Thank you for your time, and I hope that you continue to explore this website. Look over the contact information that I have given below if there is any further inquiry.</p>
